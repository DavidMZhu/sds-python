    "Last time we ended on collections. Often times we want to do something with every element in a collection. To do this we __iterate__ over a collection. To iterate means to start at the beginning of a collection, do something with the first value, then continue until we run out of values. Even though a dictionary is not ordered, it is still iterable, we just don't know the order in which we will iterate. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can imagine iterating over a list and then transforming the values in that list. Imagine you have a list of words and you want to find out the average word length ( $\\bar{x}$, the __arithmetic mean__). You would first sum ( $\\sum$ ) all the words $w$ and then divide this sum by the number of words $n$. In formulae we would say you sum all the elements: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, that big E ($\\sum$) means add all the things afterwards in the specified range. The range is specified on the top (in this case $n$ or the number of words). The i = 1 means that we iterate one word after another, rather than skipping a word or taking every third word (in which case it would show $i=3$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can translate this into computer code:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~ python\n",
    "word_list = [\"apple\",\"banana\",\"chocolate\",\"dumpling\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "word_length_sum = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in words:\n",
    "    word_length_sum = word_length_sum + len(i) # notice we use += here. \n",
    "    \n",
    "n = len(word_list) \n",
    "\n",
    "average_length = word_length_sum / n\n",
    "~~~ \n",
    "\n",
    "Above, the ```for i in words:``` is what defines the loop. It's pretty similar to English. ```i``` is our iterator. We could have named it anything, but traditionally when you don't care what your iterator is called, we use ```i``` for the first loop, ```j``` for an inner loop and ```k``` for a third inner loop. More than three inner loops and you really should rethink your program design. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can notice that ```i``` and ```words``` are variables because they are not given special colors. These colors help us understand which words are system words and which words are user-defined.  This is called __syntax highlighting__. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also use a shortcut above. Recall that in the past we have seen \n",
    "\n",
    "~~~ python \n",
    "result = x + y\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we wanted to add something to an existing variable, like when we add some numbers to a ```total```, we can do this: \n",
    "\n",
    "~~~ python\n",
    "total += y \n",
    "~~~ \n",
    "\n",
    "This is sometimes called __syntactic sugar__ as it is just a way to simplify code. In some languages, there's additional idiom of saying ```x++``` for ```x += 1```. This is where C++ gets its name. Python doesn't have this feature. It's just ```x += 1``` for us. However, later we will see some very clever syntactic sugar in python...all in due course. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will practice the concept of a loop and see some of its features. "
