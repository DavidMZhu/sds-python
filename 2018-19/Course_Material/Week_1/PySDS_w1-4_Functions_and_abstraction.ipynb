So next week we will be exploring data wrangling and this will involve the use of more complex data structures thann we have seen up to this point. These structures are all their own kinds of objects with their own features. When you see: \n",

By calling ```df = pd.DataFrame()``` you are creating an __instance__ of the DataFrame class called df. As a class it has certain methods available to it. You can discover these methods with the ```dir(<instance>)``` command, which will list the methods available to that object. Try it with the list class below:  "

If you have a method inside the class, such as the setNumber method then numberA has to be referenced as ```self.numberA```. If you are outside the class, say perhaps if you create a DoubleNumber object called ```dn``` and you want to access its numberA value directly, it would be ```dn.numberA```. \n",

That is, the systemm will provide a class with some empty methods and then you create a subclass that overwrites those methods with ones that do the things you want to do. This can be a bit abstract, so we will just leave it here. Later on you will see methods like HTMLparser and TweetStreamer that want you to create a subclass to handle data that comes in. Below is a basic example of this."
