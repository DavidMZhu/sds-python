    "# Week 4. Day 2. Working on a server \n",
    "\n",
    "Large code examples will not run on a computer. The IMDB code is really at the limit of what you might expect to be practically doing on a laptop. For many tasks there is a reason to run them remotely. For example:\n",
    "- You want to listen to a stream of data and you don't want to keep your laptop open and connected.\n",
    "- You have too much data for your computer to load.\n",
    "- You need processing power that's not available locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "For small tasks, a boost in ram might make a big difference, but for tasks on gigabytes of data or persistent connections, it won't. What makes a difference is using a dediated machine with a known history of continuous uptime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux is an operating system like Mac or Windows. It is most commonly seen in scientific work and in server administration. It does not always support the hardware of consumer devices (for example, there have yet to be reports of a Linux distribution that can drive the fingerprint reader on the Yoga 920, much to my disappointment). Linux, based on the Unix operating system, can be administered quite extensively from a command prompt. In fact, the prompt is in a shell that is its own language. Typically on a mac or linux you would be using bash or born-again shell [bash]. The good thing about this is that terminals are then easily to remote access. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can access another computer's shell remotely if we know the address of the server and it is configured for SSH. In which case we use the following syntax (on the Mac terminal, the Linux shell and Cygwin for windows). \n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "ssh USERNAME@domain.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "or \n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "ssh USERNAME:PORT@domain.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case the domain is ```<redacted>.oii.ox.ac.uk```. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Important note: I have had trouble giving my password via Windows Powershell, so I recommend downloading and installing Cygwin with the optional OpenSSH modules when you get to the install screen. This will be shown in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first log in it will ask you to trust the key, select yes. Then either type your password or copy and paste it. This is fragile. Please be systematic and careful. It will lock you out after 5 attempts. I have been given instructions to reset the lock out, but I cannot guarantee I'll be able to use them properly. **Measure twice, cut once**.  "

    "\n",
    "To copy files to a server you can use scp (or secure copy) through both cygwin and \\*nix systems. To do this scp is run from the terminal (outside of ssh) with remote and local file paths as arguments. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Editing text on the server\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to edit text on a server. There are two basic text editors. ```Nano``` and ```vi```. Many hardcore programmers love vi because it employs a huge variety of keyboard shortcuts. It's for the same reason that most people find vi to be a huge pain. There are even games out there to help you improve your vi skills. But I personally think it will be futile without serious commitment. Regardless, I actually don't mind tweaking things in ```vi``` when I'm working on a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "vi started with the command ```vi```. You are then presented with a blank screen with \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "~ \n",
    "~ \n",
    "~ \n",
    "~``` \n",
    "going down the left hand side. This is the 'end of the document'. you cannot type right away in vi, but instead have to switch to one of its editing modes. Pressing ```i``` will do that, then you ccan type. Press escape and you are out of editing mode. Then in order to make a system command you have to press ```:```. To write, you would type ```w``` and press enter. To save and exit you would press ```wq```, to quit without saving it is ```q!```. I will demonstrate this, but then return to it here. It is confusing but it has a logic to it, just a foreign one to most students here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Follow along as we will first create a python file in ```vi```, then copy it to the server, log into the server, run it and then exit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The file is going to be called \"example.py\". It will be really simple: \n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import time,datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "while 1:\n",
    "    print(\"The time is now: %s\" % datetime.datetime.now())\n",

    "## Running a program on a server\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that when we run it on the server that it keeps going until we stop it, which we can do with a keyboard interrupt. But what happens if we want to leave the server, does it continue running? No. The shell that you create when logging into the terminal only lives while you are running it. It is destroyed when the connection is destroyed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to keep it running on the server, it has to be run from a shell that is not tied to ssh. To do this we use a **multiplexer**. That is a program that is going to create a second shell window for us that we can check in on and leave. If we have left it then we can get back to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we use ```screen```. This program is a multiplexer that will spawn a new instance of a terminal for you to use every time you type screen. It then displays that window. From this second window you can run commands, then exit the screen and the commands will still keep running. Let's first ```screen``` then run the python file. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we escape this screen? It does not give a huge amount of feedback, but you would want to press $ctrl-a, d$. Control-a first lets screen know you are going to enter a command. Then $d$ is the command for **detaching**. This should bring you back to the main terminal window. To reattach you should type: ```screen -r```. If you happen to have more than one screen it will list these with random identifiers called ```pid```s. You can type ```screen -r <pid>``` to get the correct working pid. As a tip, you can name a screen when you first create it by typing ```screen -S <name>``` and then reattach with that."
