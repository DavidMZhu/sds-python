    "The numpy array is the basis of the series and data frame objects. It is very efficient. Unlike a list, the objects in an array are of the same type. This allows for considerably faster computation. Here it is worth pointing out that much of python is actually a wrapper for ```c``` code. C is a pervasive, extremely efficient language. That said, it is often cumbersome to use and does not provide anywhere near the level of abstraction of python. Numpy uses C more directly than python lists do.  \n",
