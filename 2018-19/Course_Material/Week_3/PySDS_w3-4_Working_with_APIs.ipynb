    "Recall that previously we used a get request in order to send a url string to a server. Everything after the domain name was used to find the right file and then present some important details to the server, such as those we found after the argument string. When we type in a URL in a browser we are similarly sending a GET request. \n",
    "\n",
    "A POST request similarly sends up a URL to a server. It similarly has a series of headers including a user-agent string. However, POST requests also contain a 'payload', which is a dictionary of key value pairs. The values are data for the server and the keys are what kind of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "POST requests are more secure than GET requests. For example, a POST request should happen every time you click submit after entering some credentials. By sending it through POST, the client can encrypt the data in the payload. Otherwise, you would be able to see the URL with your username and password as arguments in the URL string. Worse, if this is HTTP and not HTTPS, then the URL string is not encrypted in transit. This means that every server log, from the university's server logs to anyone who happened to be sniffing traffic on the wifi will be able to see your username and password. POST avoids that by putting these things in a payload. "
