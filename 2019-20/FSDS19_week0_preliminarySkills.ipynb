    "\n",
    "Congrats on your offer for our Social Data Science program! This program will be primarily quantitative in nature although you will definitely be exposed to a diverse set of research methodologies, all of which we hope you will find insightful and useful. In order to make the best use of your time here, we believe that having some basic experience with Python would be a considerable asset. In this course we will be using Python extensively. There are many other languages being used for data science. In time you may be exposed to some of them, at least in passing. Yet a strong comfort with Python will be key.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be teaching most of the skills that you will need to get started in the first term (Michaelmas Term, 2019). Then you can apply these in your option courses in Hilary Term 2020. Finally, you will be able to focus on specific skills to apply to a compelling research problem in the third term, Trinity Term 2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use this sheet \n",
    "This sheet is a representation of the skills that you should be familiar with. We will be starting from almost-basics in the course (with a workshop on Thursday of 0th week where you can ask questions about doing anything on this sheet). It is okay if you do not know everything on this sheet inside out before course starts, but these are topics that we will only explain briefly. Other topics related to the material below is likely to be covered in depth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although we teach from a pretty basic level of Python, we want students with no familiarity with Python to have some way to understand what is coming. The basics are pretty easy to grasp on their own through some independent study. This will give us considerably more time for the tricky parts of Python, particularly as found in Pandas, the Python library for scientific python. Basically, we expect you to be able to open this notebook in Jupyter on your own computer, run some commands, and understand some basic syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this session is optional and runs in parallel with the session on research questions. For those with stronger skills in Python, you might want to instead check out that workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want resources for practicing these, I recommend having a look at the notebooks from Jake Van Der Plas' \"Whirlwind tour of Python\": https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython. This GitHub library has a number of simple Python notebooks for the basic skills. You can actually just click on the files if they are \\*.ipynb and read them in the browser. However, to make use of them to execute code you will have to open them on your own computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use the GitHub library, the simplest possible way is to download the library by selecting the green \"Clone or Download\" button in the upper right header, and then \"Download Zip\". Once it's downloaded, unzip the archive, place it in an appropriate folder and then launch JupyterLab. From JupyterLab you should be able to navigate to that folder and view the notebooks. "

You can also store these variables in collections. Scalar data types are types that refer to specific character or single numerical value.
